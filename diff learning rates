Here is the code from the image you uploaded:

```python
# randomly selects an initial value of x
x0=1.2345
y0=(x0-10)**2

# how much to adjust the value of x each iteration
learning_rate = 0.1

# keep track of the values of x and y
ys = []
xs = []
xs.append(x0)
ys.append(y0)

# starts the gradient descent
x=x0
for i in range(1,2001,1):
    # gradient descent
    tfx = tf.Variable(x, dtype='float32')
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        ty=(tfx-10)**2
    dydx = tape.gradient(ty,tfx).numpy()
    x = x - learning_rate * dydx
    # calculate current value of y
    y=(x-10)**2
    # record values of x and y
    xs.append(x)
    ys.append(y)
    
    # if the incremental change is smaller than 0.0001, stop
    if abs(ys[-1]-ys[-2])<=0.0001:
        print(f"find minimum after {i} steps")
        print(f"the minimum y is {ys[-1]} when x is {xs[-1]}")
        break
        
# if y doesn't converge after 2000 iterations, quit
else:
    if i==2000:
        print("fail to find the minimum")

# keep track of min_y, argmin_y, and best_x in this case for plots later
min_y = y
argmin_y = i
best_x = x
``` 

This Python code implements gradient descent to find the minimum of the function \( y = (x - 10)^2 \). Let me know if you need further clarification!
